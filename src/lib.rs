//! Hasthree rust bindings
//!
//! hashtree is a SHA256 library highly optimized for Merkle tree computations. It is based on
//! Intel's implementation (intel-ipsec-mb) with a few modifications like hardcoding the scheduled
//! words. This library exposes a single function that takes an input slice of bytes to be
//! considered as chunks of 64 bytes each, and another slice where the digests of each chunk will
//! be written consecutively
//!
